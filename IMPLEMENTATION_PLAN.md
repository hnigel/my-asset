## Implementation Plan: Fix Annual Dividends Showing as 0

### Stage 1: Problem Investigation (In Progress)
**Goal**: Identify root cause of why annual dividends show as 0
**Success Criteria**: 
- [x] Understand dividend calculation flow
- [x] Identify all components involved in calculation
- [x] Test dividend data fetching for real holdings
- [x] Check if issue is in calculation, data fetching, or storage

**Analysis So Far**:
1. **Dividend Calculation Flow**:
   - `PortfolioDetailView` � `PortfolioSummaryCard` � `DividendCalculationService.calculateAnnualDividends()`
   - `DividendCalculationService` calls `getAnnualDividendPerShare()` for each holding
   - `getAnnualDividendPerShare()` first checks Core Data, then API via `DividendManager`

2. **Key Components Identified**:
   - `DividendCalculationService.swift` - Main calculation logic
   - `DividendManager.swift` - API fetching and Core Data storage
   - Multiple dividend providers (EODHD, Yahoo, Nasdaq, Finnhub, AlphaVantage)
   - `Dividend+Extensions.swift` - Core Data model extensions

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - No dividend data in Core Data for existing holdings
   - ❌ API providers failing to fetch dividend data (RULED OUT - APIs work fine)
   - Calculation logic error in annualizing dividends
   - Cache preventing fresh data fetching
   - Integration issue between DividendCalculationService and DividendManager
   - Holdings may not exist or have valid stock relationships

### Stage 2: Data Verification (Complete)
**Goal**: Check actual data state and API connectivity
**Success Criteria**: 
- [x] Verify holdings exist with valid stocks
- [x] Test dividend API providers with sample symbols
- [x] Check Core Data for existing dividend records
- [x] Verify dividend calculation logic with known data

### Stage 3: Root Cause Identification (Complete)
**Goal**: Pinpoint exact cause of zero dividends
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Identify whether issue is in fetching, storing, or calculating
- [x] Determine if specific providers are failing
- [x] Check if cache or daily limits are blocking updates

**Root Cause Found**: Daily update limit in DividendManager was preventing API calls for new symbols when daily update was already performed, even if those specific symbols weren't cached.

### Stage 4: Fix Implementation (Complete)
**Goal**: Fix the identified issue
**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Implement fix for root cause
- [x] Ensure dividend data is properly fetched and stored
- [x] Test calculation with real dividend data

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Modified daily update limit logic to only apply to cached symbols
2. Added better debugging logs to track dividend fetching
3. Added force refresh functionality to bypass cache and daily limits
4. Added UI refresh button when dividends show as 0

### Stage 5: Testing and Validation (Ready for Testing)
**Goal**: Verify fix works correctly
**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Annual dividends show correct non-zero values
- [ ] Dividend yield calculations are accurate
- [ ] UI properly displays dividend information
- [ ] Cache invalidation works correctly

**Status**: Stage 4 - Complete, ready for testing

**Key Findings**: 
1. APIs work perfectly (tested AAPL, MSFT, QQQI, VTI, KO all return correct dividend data)
2. Root cause was daily update limit logic preventing API calls for new symbols
3. Fixed by reorganizing cache/daily limit logic and adding force refresh capability

**Next Steps**:
1. Test the app with real holdings
2. Verify dividend data appears correctly
3. Test the force refresh button if dividends show as 0
