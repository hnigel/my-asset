# Gemini LLM Portfolio Analysis Implementation Plan

## Stage 1: Core Gemini Service Architecture
**Goal**: Create GeminiService.swift for API integration with proper error handling and async/await patterns
**Success Criteria**: 
- GeminiService successfully makes API calls to Google Gemini
- Proper error handling for network and API errors
- Async/await patterns consistent with existing codebase
- Secure API key management integrated with existing APIKeyManager
**Tests**: 
- API connection test with valid key
- Error handling test with invalid key
- Response parsing test
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 2: Portfolio Data Formatting and Privacy Protection
**Goal**: Create PortfolioAnalysisFormatter.swift with data anonymization and privacy protection
**Success Criteria**:
- Portfolio data formatted for optimal AI analysis
- Sensitive financial data anonymized (specific dollar amounts, personal identifiers)
- Structured data format that maintains analytical value
- Privacy-first approach with user consent mechanisms
**Tests**:
- Data anonymization preserves analytical patterns
- No sensitive data leaked in formatted output
- Structured format is AI-friendly
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 3: Gemini Analysis Manager Integration
**Goal**: Create GeminiAnalysisManager.swift integrating with existing TextExportManager
**Success Criteria**:
- Seamlessly integrates with existing export workflow
- Implements sophisticated prompt engineering for portfolio analysis
- Provides different analysis types (performance, risk, recommendations)
- Handles AI response parsing and formatting
**Tests**:
- Analysis request/response cycle works end-to-end
- Different analysis types produce relevant results
- Integration with TextExportManager is seamless
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 4: UI Integration in ExportSheet
**Goal**: Update ExportSheet.swift to include AI analysis options with proper UX
**Success Criteria**:
- New AI analysis export option alongside existing text export
- Loading states and progress indicators for AI processing
- Error handling for AI failures with graceful fallbacks
- Combined text + AI export functionality
- User can preview AI analysis before export
**Tests**:
- UI flows work smoothly for all analysis types
- Loading states provide clear feedback
- Error states are handled gracefully
- Export functionality works for combined output
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 5: Testing and Validation
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing of the complete integration
**Success Criteria**:
- End-to-end testing of complete workflow
- Privacy protection validation
- Performance testing with various portfolio sizes
- User experience validation
- Error recovery testing
**Tests**:
- Complete workflow with real portfolio data
- Privacy protection audit
- Performance benchmarks
- UX flow validation
- Edge case handling
**Status**: Complete

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing Swift concurrency patterns (async/await throughout)
- Use existing APIKeyManager patterns for Gemini API key storage
- Integrate with existing TextExportManager infrastructure
- Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns and styling
- Ensure privacy-first approach with proper data anonymization
- Implement comprehensive error handling at all levels
- Follow existing codebase architecture and naming conventions
