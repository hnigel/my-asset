# Implementation Plan: Automatic Stock Price Fetching

## Current State Analysis
- **StockPriceService.swift**: Already has Alpha Vantage API integration but uses "demo" API key and fallback demo data
- **AddHoldingSheet.swift**: Currently requires manual price input via `pricePerShare` field
- **PortfolioManager.swift**: Uses manual price for calculations, has Core Data integration
- **BackgroundUpdateService.swift**: Updates stock prices but uses demo data

## Goal
Transform the app from manual price entry to automatic stock price fetching when user enters only the ticker symbol.

## API Choice Decision
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Free, reliable, no API key required for basic quotes
- **Alternative**: Alpha Vantage (current) requires API key but has good documentation
- **Recommendation**: Switch to Yahoo Finance for simplicity and reliability

## Stage 1: Enhance StockPriceService for Production Use
**Goal**: Make StockPriceService production-ready with real API integration
**Success Criteria**: 
- Service can fetch real stock prices from Yahoo Finance API (free alternative to Alpha Vantage) ✓
- Proper error handling and retry logic ✓
- Caching mechanism to avoid excessive API calls ✓
**Tests**: Unit tests for API calls, error handling, and caching
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 2: Update AddHoldingSheet UI
**Goal**: Remove manual price input and add automatic price fetching with loading states
**Success Criteria**:
- Price input field removed ✓
- Loading indicator while fetching price ✓
- Error handling for failed price fetches ✓
- Auto-populate price when symbol is entered ✓
**Tests**: UI tests for loading states and error scenarios
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 3: Integrate Auto-Fetching into PortfolioManager
**Goal**: Modify portfolio management to use auto-fetched prices
**Success Criteria**:
- addHolding method uses fetched price instead of manual input ✓
- Current price is updated when adding holdings ✓
- Existing functionality remains intact ✓
**Tests**: Integration tests for portfolio calculations with auto-fetched prices
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 4: Update BackgroundUpdateService
**Goal**: Ensure background updates use the same enhanced API service
**Success Criteria**:
- Background service uses production API instead of demo data ✓
- Proper rate limiting and error handling ✓
- Updates happen without user intervention ✓
**Tests**: Background update functionality tests
**Status**: Complete

## Stage 5: Add Comprehensive Error Handling & User Experience
**Goal**: Handle edge cases and provide excellent user experience
**Success Criteria**:
- Network connectivity issues handled gracefully ✓
- Invalid stock symbols handled with clear error messages ✓
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests ✓
- Offline support with cached data ✓
**Tests**: Error scenario tests and offline functionality ✓
**Status**: Complete
